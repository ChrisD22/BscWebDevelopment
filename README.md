# BSc Web Development and Design
##Proposal for revised version of BSc Web Devlopment (MMU)

> We would like your feedback on the structure and content of the revised course. There might be elements you disagree with, and that’s fine. If you have alternative ideas that you feel strongly about we’d welcome your input, but please engage in a constructive manner. Working collectively, it is hoped we can build better curricula, this is intended as a starting point to drive that process. Feel free to [email Richard](http://mailto:r.eskins@mmu.ac.uk) with your thoughts. —[Richard Eskins](https://twitter.com/eskins) 

We currently run a successful degree programme from which our students go into a variety of roles including front-end, UXD, project management, teaching and marketing. A few also move towards back-end, with some eventually working in software development. We have successful graduates working in companies and organisations such as the BBC, Amaze, Reason Digital, AKQA, Beyond, Candid Sky, PushON, Frank Design, Co-op Digital, Apadami, Auto-trader and Rentalcars to name a few.

Our core themes through the three years are:

+ Web coding
+ Web programming
+ User Expereince Design
+ Management

We have an excellent relationship with industry. [You can see the sort of engagement we have through the range of guests we bring into the classroom](https://eskins.wordpress.com/2015/07/24/guest-speakers-2014-2015-on-bsc-web-development-at-mmu/). The content of our classes has also been praised for reflecting industry and current practices (for example in UX and Project Management).
