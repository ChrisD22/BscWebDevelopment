#User Expereince Design 1
<!-- Temporary title -->
===============================

+ __Year:__ 1
+ __Credits:__ 30 Credits

##Our Vision

The fundamentals of communication design. Many of our students don't have 'design bones'. We want them to learn the basics of typography, layout and colour in relation to web design. This will also include an introduction to prototyping, sketching, compositions, user exeprience design, UCD and basic HCI principles for web design.

##Unit Description

###Brief Summary

<!-- 140 characters -->

The fundamentals of communication design (typography, layout and colour), and user experience design including HCI principles, interaction design, and prototyping.

###Indicative Content

A twin-stranded module, User Experience Design 1 is delivered both off-screen and on-screen, to introduce students embarking on the course to the idea that interaction design can, and should, be developed off-screen as well as on-screen. Paper-based exercises introduce students to fundamental design principles typography, colour and layout. Complimenting these sessions, students will be introduced to concepts of user experience design, interaction design and basic HCI principles. Through sketching, prototypes and compositions students will learn to use core tools to develop their ideas.

This module runs concurrently with the Web Coding and Theory 1, and provides students with a contextual framework that is designed to complement the practical nature of that unit.

1. To equip students with a comprehensive understanding of communication design principles, including: composition, hierarchy, typography, and systems design.
1. To ensure students acquire a solid, foundational knowledge of User expereince design and HCI principles.
1. To ensure students understand the principle of ‘learning how to learn’ and begin to develop their own awareness and toolsets proactively.
