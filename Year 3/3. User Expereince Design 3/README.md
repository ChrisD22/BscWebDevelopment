###Brief Summary

<!-- 140 characters -->

Placing a heavy emphasis on a design-focussed approach towards interaction design, this module introduces the fundamentals of the craft of communication design, both off- and on-screen. Through a combination of core analogue (drawing, making) and digital (HTML, CSS) skills, students are equipped with the tools required to practice in today’s interaction design industry. 

###Indicative Content

A twin-stranded module, Design Practice Fundamentals is delivered both off-screen and on-screen, to introduce students embarking on the course to the idea that interaction design can, and should, be developed off-screen as well as on-screen. Paper-based exercises introduce students to fundamental design principles developed at the Bauhaus, Ulm School of Design, and beyond. Complimenting these studio sessions, lab sessions ground students with a solid understanding of HTML5 and CSS3, the building blocks of web-based content.

This module runs concurrently with the Introduction to Communication Design history and theory module, which provides students with a contextual framework that is designed to complement the practical nature of this module.
